# Recursive Backtracking Maze Solver in Java
**author:** fayth quinn ([*@losingfayth*](https://github.com/losingfayth))

This program solves a maze using recursive backtracking. The maze is a 2-dimensional array of characters, entered manually, where:
 * `0` is a Passage
 * `1` is a Wall
 * `b` is a Start (Beginning) Point
 * `e` is an Exit
 * `p` is the Path Taken

The program will find every possible path from `b` to `e`, printing every path it finds to the console with that path's number. The final path's number will be the total number of paths from `b` to `e`.


## Context
The program was created as part of a school project. This project was completed in ~2 days.
